Data collection took place at The MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development in Sydney, Australia. The study was approved by the Western Sydney University Ethics Committee.

We recorded EEG data while participants viewed rapid streams of videos adapted from the Validated Touch-Video Database (Smit & Rich, 2025) depicting touch to a hand. Both the adapted videos used in this project, and original videos and validation data, are available on OSF (https://osf.io/jvkqa/).

There were 32 sequences in total with a total of 2880 non-target trials (90 unique videos, each presented 8 times) alongside a variable number of target trials (showing touch to an object). Between trials there was an inter-trial-interval of 200ms. The experimental task lasted approximately 55 minutes including breaks. We also recorded questionnaire responses.

Whole brain 64-channel EEG data were recorded using an Active Two Biosemi system (Biosemi, Inc.) at 2048Hz and 10-20 standard caps. Stimuli were presented using Python and PsychoPy software version 2023.3.1.
